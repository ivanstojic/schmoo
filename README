Schmoo wants to be an SMS/MMS router and gateway with support for multiple delivery protocols, an interface towards
external mobile applications and who knows what else...

It also wants to be an alternative to Kannel one day...

I sincerely apologize for the fact that all of this code was written almost ten years ago. I didn't know any better
at that time, but now I do.

I'm working on making it better...
